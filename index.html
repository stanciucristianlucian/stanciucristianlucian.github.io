				<span style="color: red;"> <b> Cristian-Lucian Stanciu </b> <span> <span style="color: black;"> received his B. Sc. degree in technologies and systems for telecommunications (2009) and the M.Sc. in digital signal processing (2011) from Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technology, Politehnica University of Bucharest, Romania. His PhD. research was performed in the same institution and comprised the development of advanced adaptive algorithms for system identification (primarily mono and stereophonic acoustic echo cancellation scenarios) and efficient fixed-point implementations of such methods. Currently, Cristian Stanciu is an <b> Associate Professor </b> in the Telecommunications Department of the same faculty where he received his degrees. For several years he has also been working in the IT industry, mostly on finance and banking projects.</span>

				After finishing his PhD. in 2014, his interests were extended to LTE coding, spectral analysis and corresponding efficient FPGA implementations. In 2016 – 2017 he was project manager for a research grant targeting the development high performance acoustic noise reduction techniques in automobiles and briefly joined a research team working for the European Space Agency. Since 2020, he has been manager for another two research projects in the field of adaptive filters based on efficient system decomposition, by winning grants in the “UEFISCDI – Tinere Echipe”, respectively the “ARUT”, competitions. For more details, please see the section <b> <em> Research grants and fellowships </em> </b>.
